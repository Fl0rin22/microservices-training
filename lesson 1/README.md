# Lesson 1

## Introduction to microservices

- What kind of applications do we write?
- Typical Java enterprise architecture.
- Symptoms
    - Delivery is slow (code changes, e2e)
    - Codebase difficult to maintain (slow tests, coordinated changes)
    - Application difficult to scale (hardware constraints)
    - Wasted developer time (meetings, bugs, huge classes, shared libraries)
- Monolithic hell
- Example of architecture of a monolith
- Advantages (easy to develop, radical changes, test, deploy, scale)

## Why using a microservice architecture
- Scale cube
- Example of microservice decomposition
- Principles used by microservices (API, own DB, smart endpoints/dumb pipes, data model per service)
- Benefits of using a microservice architecture (testing, deploy, teams, time to market, reliability, employee satisfaction, adopt technologies)
- Challenges (distributed monolith, IPC challenges, transactions, queries, automation, rollout plan, when)
