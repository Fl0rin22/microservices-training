# Lesson 2

## Microservices collaboration

Microservices are distributed systems:
- with own database
- deployed on VM, containers or serverless
- needing insights on application behaviour (live, logs, tracing, alerts, metrics, audit logs)

IPC requires design decisions about:
- Communication styles: messaging, remote procedure invocation
- Discovery
- Reliability
- Transactional messaging
- External API
